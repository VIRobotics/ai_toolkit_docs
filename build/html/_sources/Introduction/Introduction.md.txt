**AI Vision Toolkit for OpenVINO** (hereinafter referred to as **AIVT-OV**), developed independently by VIRobotics **specifically for LabVIEW**, aims to fully utilize the deep learning and computer vision optimization capabilities of OpenVINO™. This toolkit provides high-level APIs that enable developers to quickly build, configure, and deploy deep neural networks for image processing and visual recognition applications, helping developers to bring their applications to market more rapidly.

## Key Features and Highlights

With **AIVT-OV**, you can deploy models in an open, flexible, and efficient manner. You can choose the appropriate hardware for your applications and configure cameras (including mainstream USB cameras and network cameras) for image acquisition. You can select from hundreds of image processing algorithms, including filtering, morphology, pattern matching, and classification, to obtain analysis and detection results and build fully customized machine vision systems.

In addition to traditional machine vision, AIVT-OV also offers various examples and applications for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, significantly extending the capabilities of LabVIEW developers in the field of visual intelligence. Its modular design simplifies the deployment of deep neural networks within LabVIEW.

Moreover, the toolkit maximizes the use of OpenVINO™ for accelerating deep learning inference on edge devices. This not only simplifies the development process and reduces the dependency on deep learning expertise but also maximizes the AI inference advantages of Intel hardware (including CPU, GPU (Intel), and VPU). The optimized performance and low latency are especially suitable for industrial and commercial applications requiring fast and accurate visual feedback, enabling LabVIEW developers to more easily integrate the latest AI technologies into real-world engineering and research projects, achieving faster processing speeds, lower latency, and higher accuracy.
